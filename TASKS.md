## 📅 Future Roadmap & Planned Features

### Web Application
- [ ] **Owner Portal Enhancement**: Add fields for Bedroom and Bathroom counts when adding a new flat.
- [ ] **Search Tab**: Re-enable Bedroom and Bathroom display once the backend supports this data (currently hidden).

### Mobile Application
- [ ] **Saved Properties**: Implement local storage for favorites using `expo-secure-store` or async storage.
- [ ] **Push Notifications**: Implement push notifications for new inquiries or property updates. (Implied by standard mobile features)

### Database & Backend
- [ ] **Data Consistency**: Ensure new fields (Bedroom/Bathroom) are fully supported in the Supabase schema and reflected in both Admin and Mobile apps.
